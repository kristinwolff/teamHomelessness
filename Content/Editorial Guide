## Editorial Guide

This is a running list of editorial decisions intended to guide all content writers. If you are a content writer (storyteller, journalist, etc.), please:
  - check this list before you draft a section
  - add to the list when you make a decision about the use of language or terms that should be consistent throughout the site

If you want to contest a decision already listed, please lwt us know what/why here, and ping us on slack (content channel). 

Thanks so much!
